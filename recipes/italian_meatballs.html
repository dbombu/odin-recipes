    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These tasty Italian meatballs (polpette) start off in the oven, and finish by simmering in a simple tomato sauce. We love them as a main dish, with a side of sautéed zucchini and a salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Sausage</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Minced Shallot</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Seasoning blend</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sausage, ground beef, shallot, Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to break up the ground meat and roughly mix ingredients together. Stir in beaten eggs, milk, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix all ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Pour water into a shallow bowl, and moisten fingertips and palms with water. Shape meatball mixture into about 40 ping-pong sized balls and place on the prepared sheet pan. When fingers become sticky, dip them in water.</li>
        <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a bit underdone in the center, about 20 minutes. If meatballs are larger, adjust baking time.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato purée into a large sauce pot or a Dutch oven set over medium-low heat. Stir in minced garlic and Italian herbs. Sample the sauce for seasoning, and adjust, if needed.</li>
        <li>When sauce begins to bubble slightly, add meatballs and stir gently, coating all the meatballs with sauce. Keep meatballs and sauce at a low simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, place meatballs and sauce on a plate, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
